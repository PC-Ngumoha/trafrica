## Usage

Due to the fact that _Trafrica_ is currently just a web application, setting up and making use of its features is a really simple two-step process:

### Initial Setup
First, you have to clone and setup the files on your system. Start up a terminal window and go through the following steps:

- **Clone the github repo:**
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/PC-Ngumoha/trafrica.git
  ```

- **Install project dependencies:**
  ```
  $ npm install
  ```
  **NOTE:** For this project I made use of **_npm_** as my package manager of choice. However, feel to adapt the project to work with **_yarn_** if that's what you prefer.

### Explore
Then, you can proceed to exploring the app's functionality:

- **Start up the development server:**
  ```
  $ npm start
  ```

- **Open up a browser and type in the following URL:**
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/
  ```

- **Now, you should be able to see the website's landing page displayed in your browser of choice. Enjoy**

## Upcoming Features
Due to the short timeline that was initially allocated to this project and a plethora of challenges that emerged in the course of implementing the core functionality of this application, there are a set of features that were initially intended to be implemented into the app but as of **9th August, 2024** have not yet been implemented. These features include but are not limited to the following:

- Implementation of user _login_ and _registration_ (based on local storage). _This was giving me a headache, so I decided to leave it for later_
- Implementation of a _Dashboard_ route with a page to display the profile information and recent / active bookings made by a currently logged in user.
- Implementation of a _Tours_ route to display a paginated list of all tour packages offered on the platform and currently available for user selection and booking.
- Implementation of a _TourDetail_ route to display the full details of a particular tour along with features to facilitate Booking that specific tour.

**NOTE:** _I aim to focus on implementing each of these remaining features as the time makes itself available for such undertakings. Hopefully the opportunity will present itself sooner rather than later._


## Conclusion
_Feel free to make modifications to the underlying code of the software as the software is licensed under the M.I.T license and as such is open to be freely modified and distributed as you see fit. Alright, I guess I'll leave it at that for now. Enjoy the website üëçüèæ._

**NOTE:** If you encounter any issues in using the app as directed in the earlier sections of this document, then please feel free to raise an _Issue_ on this Github repository and I'll be sure to respond to it as soon as I can.
